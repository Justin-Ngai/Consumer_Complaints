# Consumer Complaints

This repository was set up for the Insights coding challenge.

The challenge is to:
1. take customer complaints from an input file
2. group them by product-year
3. count up several statistics for these product-year's
4. order the product-year's with their statistics
5. write them into an output file

The repository layout includes:
- run.sh, a script that runs the src file to do the above actions
- input folder, holds the customer complaints CSV file
- output folder, holds the product-year-statistics (for customer complaints) CSV file
- test folders, holds tests to check how parts of the run.sh work
